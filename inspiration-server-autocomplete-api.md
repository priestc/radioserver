# Inspiration Server: Autocomplete API

This document specs out two new read-only endpoints for the **inspiration
server** (referred to in code as "radioserver") — the separate service that
hosts a studio's music library and that Takeloom queries for backing
tracks. It is written for whoever implements those endpoints in the
inspiration server's own codebase; it assumes no prior familiarity with
Takeloom.

## Background: what's calling this, and why

Takeloom is a desktop app for recording multi-instrument backing-track
sessions. One of its dialogs — "Add to Playlist" — lets a musician add a
track to a project's setlist by typing an artist and/or title instead of
picking from a pre-filtered browse list. That dialog already has two text
fields (Artist, Title) wired up to autocomplete-as-you-type — a dropdown
that's supposed to populate with suggestions pulled from the inspiration
server's library as the user types. Right now the suggestion source is a
stub that always returns an empty list, because the inspiration server has
no endpoint to ask "what artists/titles do you have matching this partial
text" yet. That's what this document specs out. **No Takeloom-side changes
are needed once these endpoints exist** — the client code that will call
them is already written and waiting; see "Client-side integration point"
at the end of this document for exactly where.

## Existing API contract (for reference/consistency)

The inspiration server already exposes these two endpoints, which Takeloom
calls today. Match their conventions (auth, response shape, error
handling) in the new endpoints so the client's existing HTTP error
handling keeps working unmodified.

**Base URL**: whatever the studio configured as `inspiration_server`
(e.g. `http://myserver:8000`) — all paths below are relative to that.

**Auth**: every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`, a
per-studio static API key configured on the Takeloom side. Return `401`
for a missing/invalid key.

### `POST /library/api/tracks/`

Request body:
```json
{"filters": [{"genre": "Rock"}, {"artist": "Miles Davis"}]}
```
Each object in `filters` is a set of AND'd field constraints; the objects
themselves are OR'd together. Response:
```json
{"tracks": [
  {"id": 4821, "artist": "Miles Davis", "title": "So What", "year": 1959, "format": "flac", "duration": 545.2}
]}
```

### `GET /library/api/tracks/<id>/download/`

Returns the raw audio file bytes for that track.

## New endpoints to add

Two endpoints, one per field — kept separate rather than a single
parameterized endpoint since they have genuinely different scoping
behavior (see the optional `artist` param on the titles endpoint below).

### 1. `GET /library/api/autocomplete/artists/`

Suggests artist names matching partial text typed into the dialog's
Artist field.

**Query params**

| Param   | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `q`     | yes      | Partial, case-insensitive text the user has typed so far. |
| `limit` | no       | Max results to return. Default `10`, hard cap `25` (reject/clamp anything higher — this runs on every keystroke). |

**Response** — `200 OK`:
```json
{"suggestions": ["Miles Davis", "Miles Davis Quintet"]}
```
A flat list of distinct artist name strings, no other metadata needed —
the client just drops these into the field, it doesn't need IDs at this
stage (an ID lookup happens later, in the existing `/library/api/tracks/`
call, once the user submits the full artist+title).

**Empty/short query**: if `q` is missing or empty, return `{"suggestions": []}`
rather than every artist in the library. (The client won't currently send
this case — it only calls out once there's at least one typed character —
but the endpoint should degrade gracefully rather than 500 or dump the
whole table.)

**Errors**: `400` if `q` is present but not a string, or `limit` isn't a
positive integer. `401` per the existing auth convention above.

**Example**:
```
GET /library/api/autocomplete/artists/?q=mile&limit=10
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>

200 OK
{"suggestions": ["Miles Davis", "Miles Davis Quintet", "Milestones"]}
```

### 2. `GET /library/api/autocomplete/titles/`

Suggests track titles matching partial text typed into the dialog's Title
field.

**Query params**

| Param    | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `q`      | yes      | Partial, case-insensitive title text. Same empty/error handling as above. |
| `limit`  | no       | Same as above: default `10`, cap `25`. |
| `artist` | no       | If present, narrow results to tracks by this artist only (exact match against the artist field, case-insensitive). See "Optional enhancement" note below — the client doesn't send this yet, but design the endpoint to accept it now so it's a no-op addition on the client side later rather than a breaking API change. |

**Response** — same shape as artists:
```json
{"suggestions": ["So What", "Solar"]}
```

**Example**:
```
GET /library/api/autocomplete/titles/?q=so&artist=Miles%20Davis
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>

200 OK
{"suggestions": ["So What", "Someday My Prince Will Come"]}
```

## Matching & ranking behavior

- Match **substring**, not just prefix — a musician typing "davis" for
  "Miles Davis" should still get a hit. Case-insensitive throughout.
- **Rank prefix matches above substring-only matches** (e.g. querying
  "mile" should put "Miles Davis" ahead of "Two Miles From Nowhere"),
  then alphabetically within each group. This is the single biggest
  factor in whether autocomplete feels useful vs. annoying.
- **Deduplicate** — if the same artist string appears on many tracks (the
  overwhelmingly common case), it should appear once in the suggestion
  list, not once per track. `SELECT DISTINCT` (or your ORM's equivalent)
  on the artist/title column, not a naive per-track scan.
- Minimum query length: consider requiring at least 2 characters before
  returning non-empty results, to avoid a single keystroke matching
  thousands of rows. This is a judgment call against your library size —
  skip it if the dataset is small enough that it doesn't matter.

## Performance

This endpoint is called on **every keystroke** from the client (there's
no server-side debouncing — that's a client-side concern and is out of
scope for this doc, but don't assume requests are rate-limited on
arrival). Each request needs to be cheap:

- Add a database index on whatever column(s) back the artist/title
  lookup if one doesn't already exist — a `LIKE '%q%'`/`ILIKE` scan over
  an unindexed text column on a large library will get slow fast. If
  you're on Postgres and want substring (not just prefix) matches to stay
  index-friendly, look at `pg_trgm` trigram indexes; a plain B-tree index
  only accelerates prefix matches.
- Cap `limit` server-side (see table above) regardless of what the client
  requests — don't trust client input for result size.

## Error handling

Match the existing `/library/api/tracks/` endpoint's conventions:
- `401` for missing/invalid `Authorization` header.
- `400` for malformed query params (see per-endpoint notes above).
- `200` with `{"suggestions": []}` for "no matches" — this is a normal,
  expected result, not an error. (Contrast with `/library/api/tracks/`,
  which treats zero matches as an error condition on the Takeloom side —
  autocomplete should NOT follow that pattern, since "no suggestions yet"
  is the common case while typing, not a failure.)

## Testing checklist

- [ ] `GET .../autocomplete/artists/?q=<3+ char partial match>` returns
      expected, deduplicated, ranked results.
- [ ] Same for `.../autocomplete/titles/?q=...`.
- [ ] `.../autocomplete/titles/?q=...&artist=<exact artist>` narrows
      correctly, and an artist with no matching titles returns `[]`
      rather than erroring.
- [ ] Missing `q` returns `{"suggestions": []}`, not a 500.
- [ ] `limit` above the hard cap gets clamped, not rejected or ignored.
- [ ] Missing/bad `Authorization` header returns `401`, matching the
      existing endpoints' behavior.
- [ ] Query with no matches returns `200 {"suggestions": []}`.
- [ ] Reasonably fast (sub-100ms range, ideally) against production-sized
      library data — this is what determines whether the feature feels
      responsive while typing.

## Client-side integration point (context only — no action needed here)

Once these endpoints exist, the Takeloom-side wiring is a small, separate
change: a new `search_artists(config, partial)` / `search_titles(config,
partial, artist=None)` pair in `takeloom/inspiration.py` (following the
existing `_post_track_query`/`search_inspiration_tracks` pattern in that
file), plugged into the `suggest` callback in
`takeloom/ui/add_to_playlist_dialog.py` in place of the current
`_no_suggestions` stub. That work is out of scope for this document and
will happen in the Takeloom repo once these endpoints are live — it's
mentioned here only so it's clear nothing else is blocking on this API
shape being exactly right up front, but changing it later is cheap.
